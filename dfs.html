        <h2> Use Case for the Depth-First Search in "Remove Islands
            " Algorithm</h2>
        
        <p class="t">
            The algorithm demonstrated here is called the remove island algorithm. 
            The name comes from the idea that black squares can be thought of as land and white squares as water.
            Additionally, all the borders are considered land. 
            Contiguous land masses that are not connected to a border are though of as islands, the goal of the algorithm is to remove them. 
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="t">
            The key intuition to solve this problem is to think about the grid of cells as many disjoint graphs such that each cell is a node and two nodes share an edge if and only if they are nieghbors in the grid.
            Then it is as simply as iterating through the graphs and performing a depth-first search for a border node.
