      <h2 class="dfst"> Use Case for the Depth-First Search in "Remove Islands
            " Algorithm</h2>
      <h6 class="d card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Demo Created by Andrew Finley</h6>
      <p class="atext">
        The algorithm demonstrated here is called the remove island algorithm. 
        The name comes from the idea that black squares can be thought of as land and white squares as water.
        Additionally, all the borders are considered land. 
        Contiguous land masses that are not connected to a border are though of as islands, the goal of the algorithm is to remove them. 
    </p>
    <p class="atext">
      The key intuition to solve this problem is to think about the grid of cells as many disjoint graphs such that each cell is a node and two nodes share an edge if and only if they are nieghbors in the grid.
      Then it is as simply as iterating through the graphs and performing a depth-first search on every peice of land that has not been visited. 
      If that seach finds and bord all of that land is kept, else we have found an island and it's removed.
      </p>
      
      
      <h5 class="stitle">Companion Project</h3>
      <p class="atext">
         This algorithm can be performed on an arbitrarily large matrix with ones and zeros.
         This is what the companion project does in the the linked repository below.
