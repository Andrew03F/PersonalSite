        <h2> Interactive Trailer/Vehicle Safety Simulation</h2>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">by Andrew Finley</h6>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="atext">
            This article is meant to give context to the Trailer Safety Simulation project found 
            <a class="button" href="https://github.com/Andrew03F/TrailerBackingSim">here.</a>
             The project was written in python using a package called pygame. 
            It can be downloaded from the previously linked GitHub repository. 
            Once there, follow the installation instructions outlined in the README.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stitle">Problem</h3>
        <p class="atext">
            If you have ever had to operate a vehicle with a trailer hitched to the back you probably found it quite simple and intuitive at first.
            It is much like driving a vihicle  normally with few execptions(e.g need to make wider turns). 
            However, once there arises a need for the trailer to be backed up, it is a completely different story.
        </p>
        <p class="atext">
            By nature, a trailer being pushed backward from a single hitch point is an unstable system, and results in many counterintuitive mechanics.
            Even when one is highly profiecient in driving ability, this will not necessarily translate to the ability to back up a trailer.
            A driver of a trailered vehicle can pose surious safety, and property damage hazards if he is not well trained.
            While it is notoriously difficult to back up a trailer, this skill can be conquered.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stitle">Goal of the Project</h3>
        <p class="atext">
            The project was made to illistrate some cause and effect relationships happending in a few common trailer cenarios.
        
            The idea behind this interactive simulation is to strips away factors that would normally be in play, leaving only a demonstration of the mechanics from a top-down view.

        <p class="atext">
            The object of the each level is to get the tailer fully across the finish line.
            Win detection is indifferent to the position of the car.
            As for collisions, if a collision of either the car or the trailer is detected the level is reset to its start state, as to discourage exploitation.

            To try out the game, go to the GitHub Repository and follow the installations instructions.
